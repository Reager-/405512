Exercise 2
A lake can be obtained by adding a colored parallelepiped (green-water) to a digital terrain model, in such a way that the height of the parallelepiped gets higher than the altitude of the bottom-valley pattern.

A suitable lake model should be added to the mountains defined by the previous exercise.
