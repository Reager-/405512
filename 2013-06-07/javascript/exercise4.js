Exercise 4
Build near the edge of the mountainous area a model (in appropriate scale) of a human settlement, randomly assembling several parallel rectangular buildings (of varying heights and sizes). The settlement must be produced in local coordinates in function of some parameters, and then placed on the scene in at least two different instances, as produced by different generator parameters.

The student is free to select any number and meaning of the generator parameters.
